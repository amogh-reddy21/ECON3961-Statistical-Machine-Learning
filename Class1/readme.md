# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an economics undergraduate developing expertise at the intersection of economic theory and modern data science. This repository showcases my journey through **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional econometric methods with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## About This Portfolio

This collection demonstrates my commitment to combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**—a skill set increasingly vital in today's data-driven economy. 

The course follows a "Concept Extension" philosophy: we start with foundational statistical tools (like OLS regression) and extend them into powerful machine learning algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net). This approach ensures I understand not just *how* to apply these methods, but *why* they work and *when* to use them.

Through hands-on labs and coursework, I'm building the ability to:
- Extract actionable insights from complex economic datasets
- Develop predictive models grounded in economic intuition
- Apply rigorous causal inference techniques to real-world problems
- Communicate quantitative findings clearly to diverse audiences

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance** where I can apply these skills to solve meaningful problems.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises applying ML techniques to economic questions
- **Coursework Projects**: Comprehensive analyses combining statistical rigor with economic theory
- **Code & Documentation**: Well-commented implementations with clear explanations
