# ECON3961-Statistical-Machine-Learning

# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an economics undergraduate building expertise at the intersection of economic theory and data science. This repository showcases my coursework from **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional econometric methods with modern machine learning techniques.

## About This Portfolio

This collection represents my journey in combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**—skills essential for modern economic analysis. Through a "Concept Extension" approach, I'm scaling foundational statistical methods (like OLS regression) into powerful machine learning algorithms (like Lasso and Ridge regression).

My goal is to demonstrate how economic intuition and rigorous data science can work together to:
- Extract insights from complex datasets
- Build predictive models grounded in economic theory
- Apply causal inference techniques to real-world problems
- Communicate quantitative findings effectively

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]** where I can apply these skills to drive data-informed decision-making.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains:
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises applying ML techniques to economic problems
- **Coursework**: Projects demonstrating statistical modeling and causal analysis
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations of methodologies and findings
